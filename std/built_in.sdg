// Decorators for built-ins.
// 1. `#[built_in]`: The compiler doesn't check the body of the func/enum/struct.
// 2. `#[any_type(T)]`: The generic parameter `T` can be anytype. The type checker and the inference engine
//                      doesn't care about the exact type of `T`.
//                      It's used to represent `Never` type of `panic`, which is a subtype of every other type, and `read_compound`, which can literally take any type as an input.
