I don't know how to apply `#[cfg(test)]` crate-wide...

so this crate has to be configured manually: set `TEST_MODE` to true when developing. set it false before release. it has a few macros that have 2 branches. one is for debugging and another is an empty one. empty ones have to be chosen (manually) before release
